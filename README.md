## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- TMDB API key (free from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

### Installation

1. **Clone/Download the project**
   ```bash
   cd movie-wheel-app
   ```

2. **Install server dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install client dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install-client
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env` file and add your TMDB API key:
   ```
   PORT=3001
   TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
   CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **Add sound effects (optional)**
   - Place MP3 files in `client/public/sounds/`:
     - `wheel-spin.mp3` - Wheel spinning sound
     - `tick.mp3` - Wheel ticking sound
     - `victory.mp3` - Selection announcement sound

### Running the Application

**Development Mode (Recommended):**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start the backend server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start the React development server
cd client
npm start
```

**Or use the concurrent dev command:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts both the server (port 3001) and client (port 3000) concurrently.

**Production Mode:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The app will be available at:
- Development: `http://localhost:3000` (React dev server with proxy to backend)
- Production: `http://localhost:3001` (Express serves both frontend and backend)

### Development Notes

- **Backend server runs on port 3001** - handles Socket.io and API endpoints
- **Frontend dev server runs on port 3000** - React app with hot reloading
- **Proxy configured** - API calls from frontend automatically proxy to backend
- **Socket.io connection** - Automatically detects production vs development URLs

## How to Use

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Socket.io client
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with Socket.io
- **Database**: In-memory storage (rooms are temporary)
- **APIs**: The Movie Database (TMDB) for movie data

### Key Technologies
- **Canvas API**: For smooth wheel rendering and animation
- **WebSockets**: For real-time multiplayer synchronization
- **CSS3 Animations**: For smooth transitions and themes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

## API Endpoints

### REST API
- `POST /api/rooms/create` - Create a new room
- `GET /api/rooms/:code` - Get room information
- `GET /api/movies/search?q=query` - Search movies

### Socket.io Events

## Customization

### Adding Themes
1. Add theme colors to `Wheel.js` colors object
2. Add theme styles to `App.css`
3. Update theme selector in `App.js`

### Sound Effects
- Add MP3 files to `client/public/sounds/`

- Can be extended to support other movie databases
- Custom movie validation can be added

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Room not found" error**
- Rooms are temporary and deleted when empty
- Check the 4-digit code for typos

**Movies not loading**
- Verify TMDB API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- API has rate limits (40 requests per 10 seconds)

**Audio not playing**
- Browser may block autoplay
- Check audio file paths and formats
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio

**Wheel not spinning**
- Ensure Canvas is supported in browser
- Check for JavaScript errors in console
- Try refreshing the page

### Performance Tips
- Limit rooms to 10-15 users for best performance
- Keep movie lists under 50 items for smooth wheel rendering
- Use compressed audio files for faster loading
